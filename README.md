**What it does:** Defines when an observer can *persist as a bounded agent*.  
**Core idea:** Active inference is treated as an organ-level mechanism under SEDP, producing maintained internal states and policies across a statistical boundary (Markov blanket) by minimizing variational free energy through coupled inference and action.  
**Why it matters:** Stable facts are useless without stable observers that can sample, store, and act.
